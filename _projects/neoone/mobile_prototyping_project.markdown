Wireframes have been widely used in the early phase of user interface (UI) design processes. However, because they lack interactivity in usage, it is not possible for users to have a realistic experience. Through our preliminary study, we obtained findings that provide implications for developing a wireframe prototyping system. We designed a prototyping tool for ad hoc mobile prototyping, which allows designers build a prototyping system quickly and make a prototype interactive. The system supports a designer’s natural behaviors and builds an interactive
prototype from the designer’s sketches. Our evaluation showed both positive and negative feedback. From users’ feedback, we discovered that our tool was useful for
interactive low-fidelity prototypes and that participants were interested in using it. Negative feedback provided design implications for a pen interaction technique to
further develop prototyping tools.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.
