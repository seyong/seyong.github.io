With the spread of social media and mobile devices, people spend more time on online than ever before.
As more people participate in various online activities, much research has been conducted on how to
make use of the time effectively and productively. In this paper, we propose two methods which can
be used to extract highlights and make searchable media indexes using online social data. For highlight
extraction, we collected the comments from the online baseball broadcasting website. We adopted
peak-finding algorithm to analyze the frequency of comments uploaded on the comments section of the
website. For each indexes, we collected postings from soap opera forums provided by a popular web
service called DCInside. We extracted all the instances when a characterâ€™s name is mentioned in postings
users upload after watching TV, which can be used to create indexes when the character appears on
screen for the given episode of the soap opera The evaluation results shows the possibility of the
crowdsourcing-based media interaction for both highlight extraction and index building.


<!-- With the spread of social media and mobile devices, people have an opportunity to watch sports or video while presenting their opinions online, and they started to communicating with other viewers inline with the scene they are watching. The opinions people posting online while watching media are likely to be relevant to the media viewers watching and it is considered to have information of the content broadcasting.

In this project, we've explored the possibility of online activity data as a source of a highlight extraction and a searchable media index generation. W -->

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
