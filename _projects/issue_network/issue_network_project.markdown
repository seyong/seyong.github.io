In this research, we propose a novel research method of
using an Issue Network system, an interactive tool that
helps to define problem spaces and encourage
representational shifts. The Issue-Network is designed to
collect issues from users, score severity ratings on each
issue, and discover problem spaces in the network of user-generated issues. The system is designed to help users break out of their own perspectives of looking into problem
spaces by enabling an alternative and more creative
way to connect nodes in a network.
We conducted a case study with a navigation device
manufacturer to define customer-centric problem spaces for
driving-related situations. We evaluated the problem spaces
generated using the tool by comparing them to those
generated from traditional brainstorming sessions. The
result proved that the network map successfully forms more
inclusive and extensible problem spaces.
