  abstract={Existing user research methods are subject to a variety of research conditions such as the amount and variety of data collected and the expertise of the facilitator of a group research session. In this study, we propose a new user research methodology using an 'Issue-Network' system, which is developed based on the theory and methods of social network analysis. The Issue-Network is designed to define problem spaces from the issues raised by users in a group research session in a form of an interactive network graph. The system helps to break out of ordinary perspectives of looking into problem spaces by enabling an alternative and more creative way to connect issues in the network. In this study, we took a case study of generating the Issue-Network on behalf of the problems raised by users in various driving-related situations. We were able to draw three navigation usage scenarios that cover relatively important problem spaces: safety and being ready for the unexpected, smart navigation and notifications, making use of the spare time. In the future, the Issue-Network system is expected to be used as a tool to identify problems and derive solutions in group research sessions involving a large number of users.}

	abstract={As people spend more time online, watching YouTube or playing games, a number of research studies arose in ways to make use of the time and energy from the crowd in doing such activities. In this paper, we have explored the possibility of converting the collective resources from the crowd in making useful information back to people. We collected posts from the online forums about soap operas on the air, and extracted instances when the name of characters in the play has been mentioned. These crowdsourced indexes become good search keywords to find the scenes where the characters mentioned in the posts appear.}

	abstract={Wireframes have been widely used in the early phase of user interface (UI) design processes. However, because they lack interactivity in usage, it is not possible for users to have a realistic experience. Through our preliminary study, several implications were found for developing a wireframe prototyping system. Based on these, we designed a prototyping tool for ad hoc mobile prototyping, which allows designers to build an interactive prototyping system quickly. The system supports designer's natural drawing behaviors and builds an interactive prototype based on their sketches. From users' feedback, we found our tool was useful for building interactive low-fidelity prototypes.}

	abstract={Mid-air finger motion takes advantage of the vast free 3D space around a device for input. Although previous research has compared mid-air finger motion with touch for mobile and large interactive surfaces, little is known about their performance for small target acquisition on ultra-small screen devices. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of mid-air finger motion and touch as input techniques for small target acquisition on smartwatches with 16 participants. Results show that mid-air finger motion can be as fast as touch but has significantly fewer errors. No statistically significant difference has been found in either mental or physical demand while using two techniques, but mid-air finger motion technique is perceived to have better performance with less frustration compared with touch.}

	abstract={With the spread of social media and mobile devices, people spend more time on online than ever before. As more people participate in various online activities, much research has been conducted on how to make use of the time effectively and productively. In this paper, we propose two methods which can be used to extract highlights and make searchable media indexes using online social data. For highlight extraction, we collected the comments from the online baseball broadcasting website. We adopted peak-finding algorithm to analyze the frequency of comments uploaded on the comments section of the website. For each indexes, we collected postings from soap opera forums provided by a popular web service called DCInside. We extracted all the instances when a character's name is mentioned in postings users upload after watching TV, which can be used to create indexes when the character appears on screen for the given episode of the soap opera The evaluation results shows the possibility of the crowdsourcing-based media interaction for both highlight extraction and index building.}

	abstract={Social media could serve as an easy and fast window to the climate of public opinion. In the current study, we examined the influence of perceived opinion climate revealed via Twitter postings in shaping televised debate viewers’ candidate evaluation. We conducted two Web-based experiments in the high- and low-stimulus elections: (a) the 2012 Korean presidential election and (b) the 2014 Seoul mayoral election. Instead of using contrived stimulus materials, we were able to examine the influence of exposure to Twitter postings in voters’ judgment of candidate performance in real time. Using a custom-designed Web application, participants evaluated the candidates as debate-related Twitter postings were being fed in real time during each televised debate. Our results suggest that exposure to Twitter postings has induced significant bandwagon effects. Bandwagon effects were pervasive even among partisans and the knowledgeable. Our findings show that more policy efforts ought to be made to strengthen the informative role of social viewing.}
