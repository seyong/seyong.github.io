##### Interaction Designer + UX Researcher
I strive to design user interactions/interfaces that both inspiring future and performant/accesible to the end user. I approached to this by qualitative and quantitave HCI methods. I studied Human-Computer Interaction at [Dynamic Graphics Project lab](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu), University of Toronto, and recently achieve Master's degree in Computer Science. 

**I am open to both Software engineer and UX researcer positions.**

Before joinig [DGP](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu) at UofT, I studied HCI at [Human-Computer Interaction + Design lab](http://hcid.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University, South Korea.
