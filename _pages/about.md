##### Interaction Designer + UX Researcher
I am excited to design user interactions/interfaces that are both inspiring future and performant/accessible to the end user. I approach this using qualitative and quantitative HCI methods. I studied Human-Computer Interaction at the [Dynamic Graphics Project lab](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu), University of Toronto, and recently earned a Master's degree in Computer Science. 

**I am open to both software engineer and UX researcher positions.**

Before joining [DGP](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu) at UofT, I studied HCI at the [Human-Computer Interaction + Design lab](http://hcid.snu.ac.kr) at Seoul National University, South Korea.
